## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
This was another good challenge to learn more about building webpages based on pre-made designs using HTML and CSS. This was a fairly straight forward challenge but gave me a chance to practice CSS Grid. As the feature cards in the desktop view design are aranged in a diamond formation, I had to learn more about CSS grid so I could place the feature card elements in specific places within the grid. Using grid-row-start/end and grid-column-start/end to specify where the elements start and stop in the grid. This is very useful property and I will continue to learn more about more ways it can be implemented in other challenges.
